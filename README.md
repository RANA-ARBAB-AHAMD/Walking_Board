Walking Board Simulation in Java

A Java-based simulation of a walking board with modular object movement and automated testing.

Project Overview

This project simulates movement of objects/characters across a board, demonstrating object-oriented programming principles and modular software design. Each class is tested with unit tests to ensure correctness and reliability.

Features

Modular Java classes for board elements and moving entities

Simulation of object movement with rules and constraints

Unit tests for all classes using JUnit

Extensible design for adding new board features or entities

Demonstrates problem-solving, algorithm design, and OOP concepts

Technologies Used

Java (core, OOP)

JUnit for unit testing

Linux/Windows compatible

Git for version control
